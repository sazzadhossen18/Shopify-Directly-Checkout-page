"Direct checkout" typically refers to a streamlined and simplified process where customers can complete their purchase with minimal steps and without unnecessary redirects or additional pages. In the context of an e-commerce platform like Shopify, a direct checkout experience means that the transition from adding items to the cart to completing the purchase is quick and efficient.
